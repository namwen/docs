# Getting Started

Welcome to Urbit, a personal server. Urbit isn't ready for serious use yet, but it's available to try out. Follow this step-by-step guide to get an Azimuth point, install Urbit, and join the community.

### [Step 1: Using Bridge](using-bridge)

In order to join the Urbit network, you need an Azimuth point, which acts like an identity and a password for your Urbit ship. Bridge is our client for managing Azimuth points. This guide tells you how to use Bridge to get your point's _keyfile_, which you need to boot your ship.

### [Step 2: Installing Urbit](installing-urbit)

The Urbit software is a command-line application that runs the Arvo operating system. This guide walks you through the installation process.

### [Step 3: Booting a Ship](booting-a-ship)

This guide teaches you how to get your ship operational and onto the Arvo network.

### [Optional: Creating a Development Ship](creating-a-development-ship)

If you want to develop software for Arvo, or if you just want to try the operating system without connecting to the network, this section is for you.

## Terminology

You've already encountered some new terminology on this page, and you'll encounter more as you proceed with this guide. Let's go over the basics:

- Arvo is the name of the Urbit operating system.
- An instance of the Arvo operating system is called a _ship_.
- Ships communicate with one another over "the Arvo network."
- Azimuth is an Ethereum-based PKI used to give each ship a unique identity on the Arvo network.
- An Azimuth identity is called a _point_. You'll need a point to use the Arvo network.
- Urbit refers to the project as a whole, including Arvo, Azimuth, and other system components.
